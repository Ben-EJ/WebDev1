## How Charting Can Be Enhanced. 
### Genralistation
There are many ways in which the charting task code could be imporroved, the first being the introducton of genralization. There are many ways to acheve this For example, instead of declearing a const array of station.xml files as so:
```
const stations = ["data-188.xml","data-203.xml","data-206.xml","data-209.xml","data-213.xml",
"dta-215.xml", "data-228.xml","data-270.xml","data-271.xml","data-375.xml","data-395.xml","data-447.xml","data-452.xml","data-459.xml","data-463.xml","data-481.xml","data-500.xml","data-501.xml"];
```
A config file could be created so the user can configure what files they want to be included, to be proccessed and visulized. Furthermore a way for a user to upload more, similar files, to be proccessed would also make this program more flexable and less restricted to a hardcoded selection of data files, such as in the block of code shown above.

### User Interface Improvements
Another highly important aspect of the charting task is to impove the user interface. There are many ways in which to do this however, due to many users, using mobile technology to access and interact with websites, in future to improve this task it would have been better to go for a more mobile first aproach to the UI design. This can be acheved in many ways. For example by using the CSS framework BootStrap. This allows developers to utalise CSS already created and enhanced for a whole range of devices, such as mobile. Furthermore due to it's
